Javid Notes:
P(A | all other vars) = P(ABCDEFG) / P(ABCDEFG) + P(~A BCDEFG)
Markov blanket - Most variables are irrelevant to the calculation, the ones that are relevent impact the
probability.

Use dictionary for probablity definitions: Populate with a for loop (for blah in range(0,128))
32 valid probabilities because two are set to true
Take probability values and populate dictionary - use bitwise integer representation, bitwise &,
bit-strings
for state in range(vars + 1)
if(state bit-wise and covid_bit == covid_bid) - Is the covid bit true
else - no

Check bit by bit to see if it is set to true, if it is assign a value, if not assign a different value.
Second tier doens't need to depend on first tier

Set probabilities, find a random valid set, do gibbs sampling
Want counters to see what bits are flipped at each state - flip N and FN at each iteration
Try to flip through all valid variables (0-5) in order, use random() to see if you flip bit or not
